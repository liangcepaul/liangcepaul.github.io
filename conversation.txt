The numbers 61, 62, 64, 68, 69, 81, 82, 83, and 85 are error codes that indicate different types of exceptions that occur in the NPU modules. They are shown on the bootloader message screen when the device fails to boot up normally. Here are some examples of what these numbers mean:

- 61: This is the code for LPM3_S_EXCEPTION, which means that the LPM3 (Low Power Management 3) module encountered an unrecoverable error. The LPM3 module is responsible for managing the low power consumption of the NPU, such as temperature protection, EDP (Energy Delivery Protection), AVS (Adaptive Voltage Scaling), and PMU (Power Management Unit) exception handling¬π.
- 62: This is the code for AP_S_EXCEPTION, which means that the AP (Application Processor) encountered a system-level error. The AP is the main processor of the device, which runs the operating system and applications.
- 64: This is the code for AP_S_AWDT, which means that the AP detected a watchdog timeout in the NPU modules. A watchdog timeout is a mechanism that monitors the activity of a program or a device and triggers a reset or an error if it does not respond within a specified time interval.
- 68: This is the code for AP_S_TSENSOR2, which means that the AP detected a fault in the TSENSOR2 (Temperature Sensor 2) module of the NPU. The TSENSOR2 module is responsible for monitoring the temperature of the NPU and triggering thermal protection mechanisms if necessary¬≤.
- 69: This is the code for AP_S_TSENSOR3, which means that the AP detected a fault in the TSENSOR3 (Temperature Sensor 3) module of the NPU. The TSENSOR3 module is responsible for monitoring the temperature of the NPU and triggering thermal protection mechanisms if necessary¬≤.
- 81: This is the code for LPM3_S_PANIC, which means that the LPM3 module detected a panic situation and entered a safe mode. A panic situation is a state of emergency that occurs when a critical error or a fatal exception happens in the system.
- 82: This is the code for LPM3_S_RESET, which means that the LPM3 module was reset by an external signal or an internal command. A reset is an operation that restores a device or a program to its initial state or default configuration.
- 83: This is the code for LPM3_S_PSCI_M3_SYS_PANIC, which means that the LPM3 module encountered a system panic in the PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) firmware or the communication with the M3 microcontroller. The PSCI firmware is a standard interface for power management and system suspend/resume operations. The M3 microcontroller runs the PSCI firmware and communicates with the LPM3 module.
- 85: This is the code for LPM3_S_PSCI_M3_SYS_RESET, which means that the LPM3 module was reset by the PSCI firmware or the M3 microcontroller.

These are some examples of what these numbers mean. For more information about these error codes and how to troubleshoot them, you can refer to [Huawei Support Documentation](^1^).

I hope this helps you understand these numbers better. Please let me know if you have any other questions. üòä
